# Hello Responsible Content Author!

This is a simple Jekyll template for your project. Please review the following checklist to get started:

1. Fill out the `_config.yml` file with your project details
2. Ensure that any public-facing web pages are accessible and [WCAG 2.0 AA compliant](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0) (though, [2.1 AA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.1) is recommended). Some additional resources:
    - The Library's [Digital Accessibilty Hub](https://staff.loc.gov/sites/digital-accessibility) (on the staff intranet)
    - [WebAIM](https://webaim.org/)
    - [Digital.gov](https://accessibility.digital.gov/front-end/getting-started/)
3. Ensure your project complies with the Library's [social media policy](https://staff.loc.gov/sites/webproduction/social-media-key-documents/) for publishing on Github Pages
4. Enable Dependabot alerts for your repository to check for vulnerable dependencies or malware.
5. Replace this content with yours!
